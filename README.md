# Clear My Space

ClearMySpace is an online platform designed to help individuals
declutter their homes and sell unwanted items to others who may be
looking for them. By listing items on ClearMySpace, users can
connect with buyers in their area and exchange goods in a safe and
convenient way. ClearMySpace provides a user-friendly interface that
makes it easy to list, browse, and purchase items, as well as
features such as reviews and ratings to ensure trust and transparency
in the exchange process. With ClearMySpace, users can simplify their
lives, earn extra cash, and promote a more sustainable and
eco-friendly way of living.


### TECHNOLOGIES

1. Python: programming language
1. Flask: a web framework for Python
1. MySQL: relational database management system
1. SQLAlchemy: Python SQL toolkit and ORM
1. HTML, CSS javascript, jQuery (and/or ReactJS): front-end


Alternative options considered:

**Database: Mysql vs PostgreSQL**
The trade-offs between MySQL and PostgreSQL are mainly related to the
specific needs of the project. MySQL is often favored for its ease of
use, speed, and scalability. It also has a strong community and many
third-party tools available. PostgreSQL, on the other hand, is known
for its robustness, reliability, and advanced features.
Ultimately, we chose MySQL for this project due to its ease of use,
speed, and scalability, which are important factors in building an
e-commerce API. Additionally, we had prior experience with MySQL and
felt comfortable working with it.

**Web framework: Flask vs Django**
Flask is a lightweight and flexible micro-framework that is
well-suited for small to medium-sized web applications. Additionally,
we had prior experience with Flask and felt comfortable working with
it.


### CHALLENGE

ClearMySpace is intended to solve the problem of clutter in people's
homes. Many individuals have unwanted items in their homes that
take up valuable space, cause stress, and contribute to waste.

ClearMySpace provides a platform for individuals to declutter their
homes and sell unwanted items to others who may be looking for them,
thereby reducing waste and promoting a more sustainable and
eco-friendly way of living.

ClearMySpace is not intended to solve larger social or environmental
issues such as poverty or climate change. It is also not intended to
be a solution for individuals who are hoarding or have a compulsive
shopping disorder.

The ClearMySpace project will help individuals who are looking to
declutter their homes and sell unwanted items. It will also help
buyers who are looking for specific items at a lower cost than
buying them new.

While ClearMySpace can be used by anyone, it may be more relevant
or useful in areas with a higher population density or a culture of
buying and selling second-hand items. However, the platform can be
used by anyone with an internet connection and access to the app or
website.
